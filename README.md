# Udacity-Image-Classifier-Project
Image Classifier Project for the Udacity Artificial Intelligence Programming with Python Nano Degree Program

Project goal: In this project you will create an image classifier application. By building your own neural network, your system will be able to identify objects appearing in images, just as humans do. You will experience how useful and efficient a neural network is, and use your newly-acquired knowledge as a substantial building block in your AI career.
